            <p class="text-content">
                    The initial idea for this platform was solve RH challenges. We started to think from HR perspective of the process they needed to go through to hire a new employee
                    and keep their history easily managed and in just one place. 

                    I was asked to take on a creative role for this project. I was responsible to release all of the design efforts which included buildid a meaningful brand, designing
                    the user interface & experience.</p>

                Problem
            </h1>
            <p class="text-content">
                    1. After watch the participants using their actual tool I found a lot of problems on the user journey for each task that they need to accomplish,. The actual tool is
                    pretty slow, boring and difficult to find sections or to make an useful search. And at the same time it was difficult to administrate the different organziations that
                    need to exist for the admin of the company. 
                    <br><br>
                    2. The second problem was to create different payrolls for each organization, company or team so I need to fin a way that become easy to create and admin companies that
                    it was capable to grown together with the companies through modules that adapt according to their needs. 
                    <br><br>
                    3. The last problem was that sometimes the payroll employees need to travel a lot to the different companies that they got in their control, so sometimes it was a little
                    difficult to keep a good communication with employees or the Human Reources area, because the actual system doesn’t got an portable app, that’s why we need to adapat our
                    software with the most important sections to a mobile app, and let us find HR and Payroll be in control of their principal task from everywhere at anytime.

                <p class="text-content">
                        The method that we used was create a session of Design Thinking where in 3 days we try to identified all the profile of the different people involved for the use of the
                        software, understand better their paint points and the needs of our differents user, 
                        <br><br>
                        I notice that the problem happen when in the different areas need to administrate their personal, most of the time it was due to lack of communication during the processes.

                            The brand needed to represent the name of the company and at the same time show that is a mexican product without falling in clichés. Midnight blue as primary color mixed
                            with greens, magentas and cyans become the color palette. In addition we use a mix of geometrical structures with a nebulae inside for the logo.
                            <br><br>
                            Also was importat to find the perfect typography choices that would complement de color choices. I settled for Quicksand and Roboto after testing various typeface options.
                            The contrast of these fonts aligned with the profesional approach of the dashboard.

                            Based on the workflows and different kind of  sketches that I created in the process, I started in work in the wirreframes in order to create a prototype and test with our principal
                            users to start to identify some problemsin the flows and star to make corrections.

                            I create at least two different solutions to observe what was better and easier for user.

                            With constant communication & feedback of the users I created the entire high fidelity design for the web app and mobile app. After that I create a design system that helps the developers
                            build the final version of the tool and that let us keep growing the tool in the future.

                <p class="text-content">
                        This was my first project as a Product Design and the one where I learn a lot of things and let me grow a lot as a designer. 
                        <br><br>
                        I really understand the importance of testing in each stage of the design process to keep resolving the problems that user can find on the flows. At the same time is pretty
                        important to motivate the user to participate in de Design Thinking to really resolve all their concerns and pain point that they have, and got a correct balance between the
                        things that the company want and what is that users really need.
                        <br><br>             
                        The importance of define the style guides for the components and got the technology that the final tool is going to use and  really listen the suggestions of the developers
                        in mind all the time.
                        <br><br>                        
                        The things that I have been done different was to test for the beginning with our real users and document always the entire process. At the same time I would have done better
                        research methods that let us save time and effort in design.</p>
