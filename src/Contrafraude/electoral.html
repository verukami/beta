                The initial idea for this platform was to solve RH challenges. We started to think from HR perspective of the process they needed to go through to hire a new employee
                In the previous elections, it was easy to notice that Mexico was disillusioned with the electoral process, they notice a lack of democracy and untrustful politicians.
                <br><br>
                After the result was showing of the elected president it was easy to know the different illegal practices that the politics doo to win some votes in a not ethic form and got favourable results at the end of elections. 
                But the elections of 2012 exist a lot of denounces that demonstrate the methods that they use that wen from giving some money to give away some electronic gadgets.
                <br><br>
So, how would we make citizens trust again in the electoral process?</p><br><br>

                The delivery included user experience and interface design for the mobile app for the two principal platforms. So the topmost concern was to create an easy-to-use application
                that let the citizens recording suspicious activity as soon as it happens and send immediately to the corresponding authorities. The app also integrated a newsfeed and a status
                that let the citizens know about the different denounces that they send.

                        The client give us a blank canvas with just a name to work on this. So we start a work with the storytelling
                        were the principal characteristics was bring "light" in the electional process with a little help of the citizens.
                        So thats why we choose as a principal element a lamp holder that could expose evil-doers. For the color palette 
                        I use neutral non-partisan color palette. </p>

                    I like to be part of giving a solution of one of the principal problematics that exist in the elections, is an important start to create transparent and legal links
                    between citizens and authorities and give a fast time in the complaint process. Is good to use the technology that we always keep at our hands like is the cellphone
                    to demonstrate the wrong things and start a rethinking in the actual process to start to have democratic and transparent elections in the future.
