                The main problem is that currently within the existing tools users waste a lot of time trying to share files, which often interrupts 
                work time. It is also difficult to manage files, photos, documents, among others that are shared.

                Designing the final look & feel
            </h1>
            <p class="text-content">
                For the moment that I was asked to join the project the team was finished the alfa version of the web app, so my principal work was 
                concentrated in the study of this and discover areas of opportunity in the UX and UI in order to make a good product design.
                <br><br>
                So I started to work on the user flows in order to map all the possibilities for the user and propose paths to become a better experience 
                and make a quick learning curve for the product, later I work on create the wireframes to be able to test with some real user and continue improving 
                the flows according to with the real data.
                <br><br>
                At the same time, I was involved in the marketing area to work in the plan for the release.
                <br><br>
                Parallel to these tasks, I began to work on the style guide to improve the work between devs and designers and make the aesthetic of the product to look modern and minimalist. 
                <br><br>

                    The first change that was recommended was to refresh the logo and design a new version, keeping these tones that reflect a clean and secure work 
                    station but applying a new pattern for these in order to get a solid and friendly image at the first look.

                    So after various iterations the result obtained was the next:</p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    I loved the experience to be able to work with people of different parts of the world but with the same vision of the build the best communication tool and 
                    I really loved to have feedback and keep in mind diverse job positions and cultures but I wish I had more time in the team in order to determine an accurate 
                    concept from the product owner. We really need to keep on mind who was our real end-user for this tool and design a high-end product that was capable to join 
                    the business and be able to operate at the pair of the biggest companies as is Slack or Teams, in the other hand it was really important to create short user flows 
                    to make it more simple for the user and less confusing.
